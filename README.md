## Education and Experience
- Jan,2018-Jan,2020. Post-doctoral,Hong Kong Polytechnic University with Prof.Jiannong Cao 
- Sep,2013-Sep,2016. Joint cultivation of doctoral students supported by NSFC University of Illinois at Chicago Prof.Philip S. Yu
- Sep,2009-Jan,2016. Ph.D,School of Computer Science and Engineering,Beihang University(BUAA),China
## Research
- My principal research interest is in large-scale information and social networks, and more generally in data mining, big data analysis, statistics, machine learning, and network science, with a focus on modeling novel problems and proposing scalable algorithms for large-scale, real-world applications, including but not limited to: spatial-temporal data mining, graph data mining, urban computing with deep learning models, and intelligent transportation systems with big data.
- In particular, I have extended conventional studies of influence mining in both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. I proposed new models and algorithms to capture and predict the future dissemination trend of cascades on social networks, and also studied how to explore both the different patterns of information diffusion and the community property of the social network to better infer the hidden structure of the diffusion network.
- My recent research focuses on urban traffic computation with multi-sourced data. We are estimating and predicting urban traffic congestions by exploring data from different domains, such as GPS probe data collected from vehicles, social media data, and also rich other data that can largely influence urban traffic including POIs, weather, and social events.
